Download [this](https://github.com/vedelaar/lq2svg/blob/master/build/distributions/lq.zip) for windows or [this](https://github.com/vedelaar/lq2svg/blob/master/build/distributions/lq.tar) for linux. Extract, then run bin/lq.bat (windows) bin/lq (linux). It's required that you have java installed on your system. If you have not installed java it will tell you (hopefully). So you can just try to see if it works.
